# chessBasic
A repo to remind myself of python and have fun with some chess tools
Will use jupyter notebooks, they seem like a good tool for lightweight coding. I TAd a few lab courses in which students had a very good time with jupyter notebooks. 

pythonTut1.ipynb: will be just me learning some python syntax
